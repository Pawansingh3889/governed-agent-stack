"""Collision tests for ``modules.query_library``.

The library dispatches by order-sensitive regex matching, so a broad pattern
declared earlier in the list can steal traffic from a narrower, later one.
Exactly that bug (pattern 5 greedy-matching "production") was caught by the
eval harness — this file prevents recurrence and covers the other pairs
where an overlap is plausible.

Every test maps a canonical operator phrasing to the description string of
the expected library entry. Strings are intentionally opaque (not imported
as constants) so a silent description change shows up as a loud test diff.
