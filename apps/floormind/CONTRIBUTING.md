# Contributing to FloorMind

FloorMind is an open-source AI query tool for manufacturing operations. It runs 100% locally — no cloud, no paid APIs, no data leaves your machine. We want to keep it that way.

Before you start, skim these two neighbouring documents — they set expectations this file doesn't repeat:

- [**`GOVERNANCE.md`**](GOVERNANCE.md) — who decides what, the first-PR-wins policy, response-time commitments, and the four hard scope lines.
- [**`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) — the behavioural bar and how to report abuse.

Security issues do **not** go in a public GitHub issue — read [**`SECURITY.md`**](SECURITY.md) first.

## The Prime Directive

**OpenAI-compatible LLM.** This project uses an OpenAI-compatible API for inference (OpenAI, or a local proxy like LiteLLM). Local vector search (ChromaDB) and local databases (SQLite/SQL Server). See `GOVERNANCE.md` for scope details.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FloorMind.git
cd FloorMind
make setup          # Install deps + seed demo database
make test           # Run the pytest suite
make eval-library   # Run the fast eval (no LLM needed)
make run            # Start Streamlit app
```

## How to Contribute

1. **Find an issue.** Look for issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
2. **Claim it.** Comment on the issue saying you are picking it up so we don't duplicate work. Your claim lasts 7 days; see `GOVERNANCE.md` § Issue assignment for the details.
3. **Branch.** Fork the repo and create a branch (`feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-description`).
4. **Code.** Keep Python clean. Follow existing patterns. Comment non-obvious logic.
5. **Test.** Add focused tests under `tests/unit/` (one file per module; see the
   existing files). Cross-module smoke tests continue to live in
   `tests/test_core.py`. Run `make test` before submitting.
6. **Pull request.** Explain *what* you changed and *why*. Reference the issue number.
   One logical change per commit; use conventional commit prefixes
   (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `test:`, `style:`) — the
   existing git log has plenty of examples.

Larger changes (new modules, new dependencies, API shape changes) start as
an **issue with a proposal**, not a big surprise PR. The shape of the
proposal is in `GOVERNANCE.md` § Decisions.

## Current Focus Areas

We are actively looking for contributions in these areas:

### High Priority
- **Docker deployment** — Dockerfile + docker-compose with API + frontend services
- **More pre-built SQL patterns** — Expand the query library beyond 17 patterns ([#2](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/FloorMind/issues/2))
- **PostgreSQL support** — Add PostgreSQL dialect alongside SQLite and SQL Server ([#3](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/FloorMind/issues/3))

### Medium Priority
- **Test coverage** — Expand pytest coverage for compliance and alert modules ([#4](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/FloorMind/issues/4))
- **Slack/Teams webhooks** — Push alert notifications to messaging platforms ([#5](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/FloorMind/issues/5))
- **Model benchmarking** — Compare OpenAI models on SQL generation accuracy

### Nice to Have
- **UI/UX improvements** — Better Streamlit dashboard for factory floor use
- **PDF parsing** — More robust extraction for scanned manufacturing SOPs
- **Multi-language support** — Queries in languages other than English
- **Scheduled reports** — Automated daily/weekly production summaries

## How to add a question to the eval golden set

FloorMind's accuracy claim is backed by `tests/eval/golden_set.yaml`. When you
add a new library pattern or want to raise confidence on the LLM path, extend
the golden set. The workflow:

1. **Decide the path.**
   - `library` — your question should match a pre-built regex pattern in
     `modules/query_library.py`. Good for catching silent regressions when
     someone tweaks a pattern.
   - `llm` — your question has **no** library match and forces real NL-to-SQL
     generation. This is where the LLM accuracy number lives.

2. **Add a sample to `tests/eval/golden_set.yaml`.**

   Library sample — no hand-written SQL needed, the judge reads the library:
   ```yaml
   - id: q21
     question: which line had the lowest yield yesterday
     path: library
     expected_pattern_description: Yield by production line (last 7 days)
     expected_columns: [production_date, line_name, ...]
   ```

   LLM sample — include reference SQL the judge will execute against the
   demo database. Result sets are compared, not SQL text, so your SQL need
   only agree with the LLM's *in output*:
   ```yaml
   - id: q22
     question: how many temperature breaches happened last month
     path: llm
     expected_sql: |
       SELECT COUNT(*) AS breaches
       FROM temp_logs
       WHERE recorded_at >= date('now', '-30 days')
         AND temperature > 5
   ```

3. **Run it.**
   ```bash
   make eval-library          # fast path
   make eval-llm              # requires OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

4. **When the LLM fails, log the failure mode.**
   Append one line to `tests/eval/failure_modes.md` under the matching
   heading (`llm/sql-error`, `llm/value-mismatch`, etc.). Don't rewrite
   history — fixes close entries, they don't delete them. This is the
   Seeler "cluster failures before tuning prompts" pattern: the taxonomy is
   what drives prompt changes, not a single hot datapoint.

5. **If your fix touches a prompt or the query library,** rerun the full
   eval and update the "fixed:" marker on the failure-mode entry with the
   commit SHA.

## Code Standards

- Python 3.11+
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- One responsibility per module
- Add tests for new functionality
- Keep dependencies minimal — check `requirements.txt` before adding new packages
- SQL safety: all generated SQL must be validated (SELECT/WITH only)
