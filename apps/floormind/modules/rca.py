"""Root-cause *scaffolding* — fuse correlated data + corrective-action docs.

The audit-safe boundary (BRC §3.7 / §3.8): FloorMind **correlates and
retrieves; a named human concludes.** This module never asserts "the
cause was X." It surfaces:

  1. candidate contributing factors, ranked by how strongly each
     dimension (line / shift / operator / supplier / product) co-moves
     with the effect — plain statistics, no LLM inference;
  2. the relevant corrective-action passage retrieved from the document
     store (the existing RAG over SOP / HACCP / BRC PDFs);
  3. a 5-Whys question scaffold for the QA owner to work through;
  4. an explicit, un-fillable "owner" / "verified_by" slot.

Why scaffolding and not inference: in a BRC audit the assessor asks
"did a competent person verify this conclusion?" An automated root-cause
*verdict* is a liability — it invites the question "did you check the
AI was right?" A *scaffold* that gathers evidence and leaves the
judgement to a named human is a productivity gain with none of that
risk. See ``docs/architecture.md`` for the rationale.

Nothing here writes to the database. All queries are SELECT-only and
flow through ``modules.database.query``.
