HACCP PLAN — Demo Seafoods Ltd
Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points

CRITICAL CONTROL POINT 1: RECEIVING RAW MATERIALS
Hazard: Contaminated or temperature-abused raw fish
Critical Limit: Internal temperature of fish must be between -2°C and 5°C on arrival
Monitoring: Check temperature of every delivery using calibrated probe thermometer
Corrective Action: Reject any delivery above 5°C. Record rejection in supplier log.
Verification: Daily calibration of thermometers. Monthly review of rejection records.

CRITICAL CONTROL POINT 2: COLD STORAGE
Hazard: Bacterial growth due to temperature abuse during storage
Critical Limit: Cold rooms must maintain temperature between 0°C and 4°C at all times
Monitoring: Automated temperature logging every 15 minutes. Manual check every 2 hours.
Corrective Action: If temperature exceeds 5°C for more than 30 minutes, assess product safety. If exceeded 8°C, quarantine all product for QC assessment.
Verification: Weekly review of temperature logs. Monthly calibration of sensors.

CRITICAL CONTROL POINT 3: PROCESSING
Hazard: Cross-contamination, allergen contamination, foreign body contamination
Critical Limit: Processing area temperature must not exceed 12°C. Metal detection on all finished products.
Monitoring: Continuous temperature monitoring. Metal detector checks every hour with test pieces.
Corrective Action: Stop production if area exceeds 15°C. Reject and quarantine any product that fails metal detection.

CRITICAL CONTROL POINT 4: DISPATCH
Hazard: Temperature abuse during loading and transport
Critical Limit: Product temperature must be between 0°C and 4°C at dispatch. Vehicle temperature must be below 5°C.
Monitoring: Check product and vehicle temperature before loading. Record on dispatch log.
Corrective Action: Do not load if vehicle is above 5°C. Re-chill product if above 4°C.

2. Use the calibrated digital thermometer (stored in the QC office).
3. Record the temperature on the daily temperature log sheet (Form TC-001).
4. Acceptable temperature ranges:
   - Cold Room 1 (Fresh Fish): 0°C to 4°C
   - Cold Room 2 (Ready to eat): 0°C to 4°C
   - Zone D: -18°C or below
   - Zone F: 0°C to 5°C
   - Zone E: Below 12°C

5. If temperature is outside acceptable range:
   a. Immediately inform the Shift Manager or Production Manager
   b. Check the refrigeration unit for obvious faults
   c. Do NOT open the door unnecessarily
   d. Contact maintenance if the issue persists for more than 15 minutes
   e. If product safety is compromised, quarantine all affected stock

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: Allergen Management
Document Number: SOP-AL-001

PURPOSE: To prevent allergen cross-contamination and ensure accurate labelling.

ALLERGENS PRESENT ON SITE:
- Fish (all species)
- Crustaceans (prawns, crab)
- Molluscs (mussels, squid)
- Wheat (in breaded products)
- Egg (in batter)
- Milk (in fish pie mix, sauces)
- Celery (in some marinades)
- Mustard (in some coatings)
- Sulphites (in some preserved products)

ALLERGEN MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES:

1. SEGREGATION: Products containing different allergens must be physically separated during storage, preparation, and processing.

2. SCHEDULING: Production must be scheduled to run non-allergen products BEFORE allergen-containing products. If this is not possible, a full validated clean must be performed between runs.

3. CLEANING: Between allergen changeovers:
   - Full strip-down and clean of all contact surfaces
   - Use hot water (above 82°C) and approved detergent
   - Visually inspect all surfaces
   - ATP swab test on 3 random surfaces (must read below 10 RLU)
   - Record results on Allergen Clean Record (Form AL-002)

4. LABELLING: All finished products must display allergen information in bold text in the ingredients list. Any precautionary allergen statements (may contain) must be risk-assessed and approved by the Technical Manager.

5. STAFF: All staff must wash hands and change gloves between handling different allergen products. Staff must not bring food containing allergens into production areas.
