## Companion tools

FloorMind is part of a small set of on-prem tools for regulated manufacturing data. The three work cleanly on their own but compose into a platform:

- **[sql-sop](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/sql-guard)** — Static SQL safety layer. FloorMind generates SQL via the LLM; sql-sop validates that SQL against 44 rules before execution. Read-only enforcement plus static pattern checks, defence in depth.
- **[Manufacturing Compliance Dashboard](https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/manufacturing-compliance-dashboard)** — a live BRC/HACCP compliance dashboard that pairs with FloorMind's query layer.

---

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Factory managers and shift leads need answers from production data — yield, waste, compliance, traceability. Today, they either write SQL themselves (error-prone), wait for IT (slow), or export to Excel (outdated by the time it opens). FloorMind lets anyone type a question in plain English and get an answer in seconds, directly from the database.

### Key Features

- **Ask in English, get answers in seconds** — no SQL knowledge required
- **Runs entirely on your machine** — no data leaves the factory network
- **SQL injection protection** — validates every query before execution
- **Covers 7 business areas** — production, waste, orders, compliance, staff, suppliers, traceability
- **Smart alerts** — flags yield drops, temperature breaches, and overtime automatically
- **Domain-aware** — loads compliance, production, and waste rules at runtime for context-aware answers

> **Scope: FloorMind does not answer natural-language queries about real-time
> temperature data.** Temperature monitoring in BRC-audited operations is a
> formal closed loop (calibrated probes → SCADA → automated log → QA
> sign-off). Routing temperature questions through an LLM would let
> operators get a soft "no excursions" answer without consulting the
> formal monitoring system, breaking the audit trail. Temperature breach
> *push alerts* (`modules/alerts.py`) stay — those are explicit,
> traceable, and tied to named recipients. The compliance dashboard
> remains the authoritative real-time temperature surface.

## Why this matters for agentic AI

The 2026 agentic-AI reports (McKinsey, Deloitte, and others) keep landing on the same point: enterprises don't lack agents, they lack **governed** ones — only about one in five has mature oversight, and most projects stall on data foundations and governance, not the model. The shift they describe is from *approving tools* to *commissioning, onboarding, and governing agents like digital employees* — scoped, supervised, and accountable. FloorMind is built that way:

- **read-only** by default — only `SELECT`/`WITH`; writes blocked
- every query **validated and audit-logged** (`logs/audit.jsonl`) for traceability
- **scoped** away from questions it shouldn't answer (real-time temperature stays with the certified monitoring loop)
- **measured** by an eval harness, not vibes
- **on-prem** — nothing leaves the network

---

Manufacturing teams query data through Excel exports and IT requests. FloorMind lets any operator ask the database in English — offline, on-prem, no API keys.

It works against a manufacturing schema mapped into business domains (production, traceability, orders, compliance, staff, suppliers, waste), so each question is routed to the right tables before the LLM ever sees them.

**Step 1 — Domain detection.** User asks about "orders" → schema registry maps it to 2 tables out of 19. Only those go to the LLM.

**Step 2 — SQL generation.** Ollama converts the question to SQL. Pre-built library short-circuits the 10 most common questions.

**Step 3 — Execution.** SQLAlchemy runs the query (read-only — INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE blocked). Result rendered as table + Plotly chart.

**Step 4 — Explanation.** LLM summarises the result in English with context ("above average", "trending down").

## Build it

```bash
# Step 1: Get Ollama running
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull gemma3:12b      # default model, better SQL accuracy

# Step 2: Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/Pawansingh3889/FloorMind.git
cd FloorMind
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 3: Seed demo data (60 days of synthetic manufacturing data)
python scripts/seed_demo_db.py
# → Products: 10 | Runs: 662 | Orders: 451 | Temp logs: 3,600 | Materials: 282

# Step 4: Index documents for RAG search
python scripts/ingest_documents.py
# → Indexing PDFs into ChromaDB vectors...

# Step 5: Run
streamlit run app.py
# → FloorMind running at http://localhost:8501
```

Or one-liner: `make setup && make run`

## Docker deployment (production)

Isolated deployment pattern inspired by PyCon DE 2026: "Building Secure Environments for CLI Code Agents" (Nezbeda).

```bash
# One-command deployment: app + Ollama in isolated containers
docker compose up -d

# FloorMind: http://localhost:8501
# Ollama:  http://localhost:11434
```

What this gives you:
- FloorMind runs as non-root user in a minimal Python 3.11 container
- Ollama runs in a separate container (isolated bridge network)
- Model weights persist in a named volume
- Logs persist outside containers at `./logs/`
- Health checks on both services with auto-restart
- No secrets in images — all configuration via environment variables

## Audit logging

Every agent interaction is logged to `logs/audit.jsonl` as structured JSON.

```bash
# Last 10 SQL executions
jq -c 'select(.event == "sql_executed")' logs/audit.jsonl | tail -10

# All validation failures
jq -c 'select(.event == "sql_validated" and .passed == false)' logs/audit.jsonl

# Questions per day
jq -r 'select(.event == "question_asked") | .timestamp[:10]' logs/audit.jsonl | sort | uniq -c
```

Events logged: `question_asked`, `sql_generated`, `sql_validated`, `sql_executed`, `llm_call`.

Required for BRC traceability — every query, who asked, what SQL ran, what came back.

---

## Run the tests

Three suites, three commands:

```bash
make test           # cross-module smoke (tests/test_core.py) + per-module (tests/unit/)
make eval-library   # library fast-path eval — no Ollama needed
make eval           # full eval (library + LLM paths) — needs Ollama + gemma3:12b
```

Coverage at a glance:

| Suite | File | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| Smoke | `tests/test_core.py` | Config, SQL dialect, schema registry, database, compliance, alerts, waste, SQL safety, doc search — one test per concern. |
| Per-module | `tests/unit/test_sql_validator.py` | Every stage of the 5-stage SQL validation pipeline (statement type, injection, table existence, column resolution, row-limit injection). |
| Per-module | `tests/unit/test_query_library.py` | One canonical question per library pattern + explicit regex-collision guards. |
| Per-module | `tests/unit/test_schema_registry.py` | Domain detection for all 6 domains, edge cases, registry contracts. |
| Eval | `tests/eval/golden_set.yaml` | 20 factory questions — 14 library-path, 6 LLM-path. Judge compares result sets against the demo database. |

Failure-mode taxonomy for the eval harness lives in
[`tests/eval/failure_modes.md`](tests/eval/failure_modes.md) — it's a
living document that grows as the LLM path hits real failures.

---

## Connect to production SQL Server

```bash
# Environment variable — connection string
FLOORMIND_DB=mssql+pyodbc://user:pass@server/database?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server

# Windows Auth
FLOORMIND_DB=mssql+pyodbc://server/database?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server&trusted_connection=yes
```

Then edit `schema.yaml` to map your tables to FloorMind's 6 business domains:

```yaml
traceability:
  tables:
    ProductionBatch: BatchID, BatchNo, ProductCode, ProductionDate
    RawMaterialIntake: IntakeID, ProductCode, BatchNo, SupplierCode

production:
  tables:
    ProductionRuns: RunID, ProductCode, FinishedOutputKg, WasteKg

# Also: orders, staff, stock, compliance
```

> **Schema mapping:** FloorMind maps a manufacturing schema into 6 business domains (production, traceability, orders, compliance, staff, suppliers), with pre-built SQL queries and production push alerts. Temperature data is not queryable through the NL surface — see the scope note above.

> The schema can model a batch-centric run structure (one batch feeding one run that produces several products), and the registry maps the tables to business domains for efficient NL-to-SQL generation.

## Production Queries

8 pre-built production queries for instant results (no LLM round-trip):

| # | Query | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Daily yield by production line | Yield % per line for a given date, compared to 30-day average |
| 2 | Batch traceability lookup (batch to vessel) | Full lineage from finished batch back to raw material vessel/intake |
| 3 | Temperature breach report | All cold-store and in-process readings outside threshold in a date range |
| 4 | Allergen changeover check | Validates cleaning records between allergen-class changeovers on a line |
| 5 | Shift productivity (day vs night) | Output kg, waste kg, and yield % split by shift for comparison |
| 6 | Giveaway analysis by product | Overweight giveaway per product vs target, ranked by cost impact |
| 7 | Open critical non-conformances | All open NCs with severity = Critical, grouped by category and age |
| 8 | MSC/ASC certification status | Current certification status per species/supplier with expiry dates |

## Production Alerts

3 production-specific alerts monitored continuously:

- **Yield drops** — flags when line yield falls below the 30-day rolling average by a configurable threshold
- **Temperature breaches** — triggers when any cold-store or in-process sensor exceeds its defined limit
- **Open critical NCs** — alerts when critical non-conformances remain unresolved past the SLA window

---

## Vector Search Backend

FloorMind supports two vector backends for RAG document search:

### ChromaDB (default)

Local, embedded vector store. No external services needed -- works out of the box.

```bash
# No extra config required. ChromaDB is the default.
FLOORMIND_VECTOR_DB=chromadb   # optional, this is the default
```

### PostgreSQL + pgvector (production)

Shared, production-grade vector store backed by PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension. Recommended when multiple FloorMind instances need to share the same document index, or when you want vector search co-located with your existing PostgreSQL database.

```bash
# 1. Install pgvector in your PostgreSQL instance
#    https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector

# 2. Point FloorMind at the database
FLOORMIND_VECTOR_DB=pgvector
FLOORMIND_VECTOR_PG_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:pass@host:5432/floormind
```

FloorMind will automatically create the `documents` table and the pgvector extension on first use. If PostgreSQL is unreachable, the system falls back to ChromaDB so the app keeps working.

RAG: ChromaDB or PostgreSQL pgvector
Monitoring: Sentry (opt-in)

MCP Servers (opt-in):
    [Database Server :9000] --- query, discover tables/columns, domain schema
    [Doc Search Server :9001] --- semantic search, domain context
    [MCP Client] --- connects to servers or falls back to direct module calls
```

## MCP Server Architecture

FloorMind can optionally expose database and document search as [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers, decoupling data access from agent logic. This follows patterns from the PyCon DE 2026 talk on building agentic systems with LangGraph and MCP.

| Server | Port | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Database | 9000 | `query_database`, `discover_tables`, `discover_columns`, `get_schema_for_domain` |
| Doc Search | 9001 | `search_documents`, `get_document_count`, `get_domain_context` |

MCP is opt-in. Set `MCP_ENABLED=true` to use the servers. When disabled (default), FloorMind calls modules directly — no behaviour change.

```bash
# Start MCP servers
python -m mcp_servers.database_server
python -m mcp_servers.doc_search_server

# Run FloorMind with MCP
MCP_ENABLED=true streamlit run app.py
```

See `specs/mcp-servers.md` for full documentation.

## Agent Architecture

FloorMind uses a LangGraph state graph to structure the NL-to-SQL pipeline as a multi-step agent with 6 nodes:

```
question -> [detect_domain] -> [check_library] --match--> [validate_sql] -> [execute_sql] -> [explain_results]
                                     |                          |
                                  no match                  invalid SQL
                                     |                          |
                               [generate_sql] -------->     END (error)
```

| Node | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `detect_domain` | Maps the question to one of 6 business domains via keyword scoring |
| `check_library` | Checks 18 pre-built regex patterns for a fast-path match (no LLM needed) |
| `generate_sql` | LLM generates SQL from the question and domain-scoped schema |
| `validate_sql` | Safety gate -- only SELECT/WITH allowed, blocks dangerous keywords |
| `execute_sql` | Runs the validated query via SQLAlchemy (read-only) |
| `explain_results` | LLM explains results in plain English with business context |

**Pre-built library fast path** -- the 18 most common production questions bypass LLM generation entirely, returning tested SQL in milliseconds.

**SQL safety validation** -- every query passes through a 5-stage validation pipeline: statement type check, injection pattern detection (tautologies, UNION, comments, stacked queries), table existence, column existence, and automatic row limit enforcement. See `specs/security.md` for the full threat model.

**Structured state flow** -- the full state `{question, domain, sql, results, explanation, error}` flows through each node, making the pipeline observable and debuggable.

See `modules/agent_graph.py` for the implementation.

---

## Error Monitoring

FloorMind supports optional error monitoring via [Sentry](https://sentry.io). Set the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable to enable it. If not set, monitoring is completely disabled (no-op).

```bash
export SENTRY_DSN="https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0"
export ENVIRONMENT="production"   # optional, defaults to "development"
```

Errors in the SQL agent pipeline are automatically reported when Sentry is enabled.

## Limitations

| Area | Reality |
|---|---|
| LLM accuracy | Measured per release — see `tests/eval/golden_set.yaml` (library path + LLM path). Run `make eval` locally to get current numbers for your model + schema. |
| Speed | 10-25 sec per query on 16GB RAM. LLM is the bottleneck. |
| Auth | Password via Streamlit secrets. No multi-user roles. |
| Safety | Read-only. SELECT only — INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE blocked. |

### Evaluation

The accuracy claim is backed by a golden set (`tests/eval/golden_set.yaml`) with
two paths:

- **Library path** — 14 questions that should hit pre-built SQL patterns. Runs
  with no LLM, catches regressions when someone edits `query_library.py`.
- **LLM path** — 6 questions the library can't match, forcing real NL-to-SQL
  generation. Generated SQL is executed against the demo database and compared
  to a reference SQL's result set.

```bash
make eval-library   # fast, CI-safe, no Ollama needed
make eval-llm       # requires Ollama + gemma3:12b
make eval           # both
```

Failure modes are catalogued in `tests/eval/failure_modes.md` — the taxonomy
grows as real failures arrive (pattern from Martin Seeler's "AI Evals Done
Right", PyCon DE 2026).
